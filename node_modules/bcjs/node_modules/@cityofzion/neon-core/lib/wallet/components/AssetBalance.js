 * Balance of an UTXO asset.

 * Spent coins have been used once in confirmed transactions and cannot be used anymore. They are kept here for tracking purposes.
 * Unconfirmed coins have been used in transactions but are not confirmed yet. This is a holding state until we confirm that the transactions are mined into blocks.
